                    Paigo is a financial institution. This project was about a web app built to administrate customers,
                    granted loans and other products.

                <p class="lead">
                    I built this app from scratch to help them administer their business. During this project I was also
                    contributing to find the best model for the problem they had.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">We used Scrum to manage the project. Before every review I pushed a docker image and we
                    used it as the output of the sprint.</p>
